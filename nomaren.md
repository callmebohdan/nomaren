Great choice! Building a Cross-Platform Media Player is a fantastic project that can help you delve into various aspects of C++ programming, multimedia handling, and cross-platform development. Here's a more detailed breakdown of what you can focus on:

### Core Features:
1. **Basic Media Playback:**
   - **Audio/Video Support:** Implement support for playing common audio (MP3, WAV) and video (MP4, AVI) formats.
   - **Play/Pause/Stop:** Basic controls for starting, pausing, and stopping media.
   - **Seek:** Allow users to jump to different parts of the media.

2. **Playlist Management:**
   - **Create/Load Playlists:** Users can create playlists and load existing ones.
   - **Shuffle/Repeat:** Add options for shuffling and repeating tracks.

3. **Volume Control:**
   - **Adjust Volume:** Users can control the playback volume.
   - **Mute/Unmute:** Provide a mute option.

4. **Cross-Platform Support:**
   - **Windows, macOS, Linux:** Ensure the application works across these platforms.
   - **UI Consistency:** Use Qt to maintain a consistent user interface across platforms.

5. **Media Metadata Display:**
   - **Show Info:** Display information like track title, artist, album, and duration.
   - **Cover Art:** Show album or video cover art if available.

### Advanced Features (Optional):
1. **Streaming Support:**
   - **Online Streaming:** Implement support for streaming media from URLs.
   - **Radio Streaming:** Add support for internet radio streams.

2. **Subtitles and Closed Captions:**
   - **Subtitle Loading:** Load and display subtitles (e.g., SRT files) with video.
   - **Sync Controls:** Adjust subtitle timing to sync with video.

3. **Equalizer:**
   - **Audio Filters:** Implement an equalizer with presets (e.g., bass boost, treble).
   - **Custom Settings:** Allow users to create custom equalizer settings.

4. **Custom Skins/Themes:**
   - **User Customization:** Let users change the look and feel of the player with different skins or themes.

5. **Media Library:**
   - **Library Management:** Implement a media library to organize and search media files.
   - **Smart Playlists:** Automatically generate playlists based on criteria like recently added, most played, etc.

6. **Remote Control:**
   - **Mobile App:** Create a companion mobile app (using Qt for mobile) to control playback.
   - **Network Control:** Use network protocols to control the player from another device.

### Tools and Libraries:
- **C++/Qt:** For building the core application and user interface.
- **CMake:** For building and managing cross-platform project files.
- **GStreamer:** For handling media playback, streaming, and processing.
- **SQLite:** For managing playlists, media library, and user settings.
- **OpenSSL:** For secure streaming if you decide to implement online streaming features.

This project will not only enhance your C++ and Qt skills but also give you valuable experience in multimedia processing and cross-platform development. Let me know if you need further guidance on any specific part of this project!

Yes, you can definitely implement support for pictures in "Nomaren"! This would make your media player more versatile, turning it into a comprehensive multimedia viewer. Here's how you can approach adding image support:

### 1. **Core Features for Image Support:**
   - **Image Formats:** Support common image formats like JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF (including animated GIFs), and TIFF.
   - **Image Viewer:** Implement an image viewer with basic controls such as zoom in/out, rotate, and fit to screen.
   - **Slideshow Mode:** Allow users to view images in a slideshow with customizable transition effects and timings.

### 2. **Integration with Existing Features:**
   - **Unified Media Library:** Integrate images into the same media library that manages your audio and video files, allowing for easy browsing and organization.
   - **Playlist Support:** Include images in playlists, so users can mix and match videos, music, and images in a single playlist.
   - **Metadata Display:** Show image metadata such as resolution, file size, and creation date.

### 3. **Advanced Image Features (Optional):**
   - **Basic Editing:** Add basic image editing features like cropping, brightness/contrast adjustment, and applying filters.
   - **Image Format Conversion:** Allow users to convert images between different formats directly in the player.
   - **Tagging and Categorization:** Implement tagging and categorization features to help users organize their image collections.

### 4. **Technical Implementation:**
   - **Qt:** Qt has excellent support for image handling through its `QImage`, `QPixmap`, and `QLabel` classes, making it straightforward to load, display, and manipulate images.
   - **GStreamer:** While GStreamer is mainly focused on video and audio, you can stick with Qt’s built-in image handling for this part.
   - **SQLite:** Extend your database to store image metadata, allowing for efficient searching and organizing within the media library.

### 5. **UI Considerations:**
   - **Image Viewer Layout:** Design a dedicated layout for viewing images, with options for different viewing modes (e.g., grid view, single view).
   - **Seamless Switching:** Allow users to seamlessly switch between different media types (e.g., going from viewing a photo to playing a video).

Adding image support will make Nomaren a more comprehensive and appealing multimedia application. Let me know if you need help with any of these features!
